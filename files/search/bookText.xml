                   The  "Supplementary  Books"  series  has  been  compiled  to  help
            learners overcome common obstacles in learning English and make the
            process  more  efficient  and  achievable.  The  series  consists  of five

            workbooks,  designed  for  primary  students  from  levels  1  to  5,  aimed  at
            reinforcing classroom knowledge and assisting in exam preparation.

                   The level 4 workbook includes 20 learning units organized around six
            key tasks:
                   Part 1: VOCABULARY

                   Focuse  on  expanding  learners'  vocabulary,  emphasizing  not  only
            memorization  but  also  active  usage  in context. Learners  will  develop
            techniques to build a versatile and strong vocabulary.

                   Part 2: GRAMMAR
                   Cover key grammatical concepts, offering practical exercises and
            explanations  to  deepen  learners'  understanding  and  help  them  apply

            rules naturally.
                   Part 3: LISTENING

                   Provide interactive listening exercises to enhance learners' ability to
            understand  spoken  language  in  various  contexts,  preparing  them  for
            real-world conversations and interactions.

                   Part 4: SPEAKING
                   Encourage learners to practice pronunciation, sentence structure,

            and spontaneous conversation in a supportive setting through interactive
            speaking activities.
                   Part 5: READING

                   Help  learners  improve  reading  fluency  and  comprehension,
            empowering them to engage with more complex texts and materials.
                   Part 6: WRITING

                   Offer  various  writing  exercises  that  focus  on  different  aspects  of
            written  communication,  helping  learners  build  confidence  and
            strengthen their writing skills.

                   The authors  hope  this  book  will  serve as  a valuable  resource  for
            learners  on  their  journey  to  mastering  English,  while  also  welcoming

            feedback for further improvement in future editions.]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[TABLE OF CONTENTS

                     Yesterday was a busy day for me and my family. It was Sunday and my
             father didn't go to work. He was at home and watered his plants. My mother was

             at home, too. It was sunny so she washed all the winter clothes. My little brother

             - Johny, went to the zoo with uncle Tom and aunt Sylvia. They visited many
             animals and Johny painted a picture of a giraffe. Yesterday afternoon I was at

             school, but I wasn't at the classroom because I didn’t have

             any classes. I was in the school library and read a Literature book.
             In the evening I was at home and helped mysister Nana with

             her homework. I went to bed late last night.

                                             CHILDREN'S DAY IN JAPAN

                     In the past, people in Japan divided Children's Day into two days: Boy’s Day
              on May 5th and Girl's Day on March 3rd.

                     Now people  celebrate  Children's Day on May 5th. This day is a national
              holiday. During the time around Children's Day, families do many things to celebrate
              their children. They put iris leaves and roots in the bathtub of their children. They
              believe that the iris leaves and roots are good for children's health and protect them
              from  diseases. The  bath  houses open  early  in  the  morning  and  close  late  in  the
              evening on this day. People also eat a special rice cake. It is made of sweet red bean
              paste.

                     Children's Day is a great day for families because they can celebrate their
              children and have enjoyable time.
