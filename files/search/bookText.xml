                       In the past, people in Japan divided Children's Day into two days: Boy’s
               Day on May 5th and Girl's Day on March 3rd.
                       Now people celebrate Children's Day on May 5th. This day is a national
               holiday. During the time around Children's Day, families do many things to
               celebrate their children. They put iris leaves and roots in the bathtub of their
               children. They believe that the iris leaves and roots are good for children's
               health and protect them from diseases. The bath houses open early in the
               morning and close late in the evening on this day. People also eat a special rice
               cake. It is made of sweet red bean paste.

                       Children's Day is a great day for families because they can celebrate
               their children and have enjoyable time.
